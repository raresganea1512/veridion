## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 Smart classification that understands company descriptions like a human would
- 🏷️ Multi-label classification - because companies can wear many hats
- 🔍 Deep analysis of company descriptions, tags, sectors, and niches
- 📊 TF-IDF powered similarity matching for accurate categorization
- 🎯 Direct keyword matching for precise results
- ⚙️ Fully customizable thresholds and matching criteria

## 📥 What Goes In?

The system expects two CSV files:

1. `company_list.csv` - Your company database with:

   - Description: What the company does
   - Business Tags: Company's specialties
   - Sector: Industry sector
   - Category: Business category
   - Niche: Specific market focus

2. `insurance_taxonomy.csv` - Your insurance category dictionary with:
   - Category: Insurance category name
   - Description: What this category means

## 📤 What Comes Out?

The system generates `classified_companies.csv` with all your original data plus:

- Insurance Labels: A smart list of relevant insurance categories for each company

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Data Loading** 📚

   - Reads your company data and insurance categories
   - Prepares everything for analysis

2. **Preprocessing** 🧹

   - Cleans and standardizes text
   - Prepares data for analysis
   - Removes noise and irrelevant information

3. **Classification** 🎯

   - Direct keyword matching
   - Smart similarity analysis
   - Context-aware categorization

4. **Validation** ✅
   - Quality checks
   - Relevance verification
   - Multi-label assignment

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Drop your files in the `data` directory:

   - `company_list.csv`
   - `insurance_taxonomy.csv`

2. Run the magic:

   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

3. Find your results in `output/classified_companies.csv`

## 🎯 Classification Magic

The system uses three powerful methods to categorize companies:

1. **Direct Matching** 🎯

   - Spots insurance keywords in descriptions
   - Analyzes business tags
   - Checks sector and category context

2. **Similarity Matching** 🔍

   - Uses TF-IDF vectors for smart comparison
   - Calculates semantic similarity
   - Matches like a human would

3. **Context Validation** ✅
   - Ensures relevance
   - Verifies insurance context
   - Picks the most relevant categories

## ⚡ Performance

Built for speed and accuracy:

- Handles large datasets with ease
- Provides precise category assignments
- Supports multiple labels per company
- Maintains high accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Natural language processing libraries
- CSV processing tools

## 📝 Example Output

```csv
Description,Business Tags,Sector,Category,Niche,Insurance Labels
"Company description...","['tag1', 'tag2']",Services,Category,Niche,"Auto Insurance, Health Insurance"
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

- The system is optimized for insurance categorization
- Companies can have multiple insurance labels
- Results are sorted by relevance
- Both exact matches and semantic similarity are used

## 🤔 The Thought Process Behind This Solution

Let's break down how I approached building this classifier in simple terms:

### 1. The Problem

Imagine you have a list of companies, and you need to figure out what kind of insurance they might need. It's like being an insurance expert who needs to read through company descriptions and say "Ah, this company needs health insurance" or "This one needs property insurance."

### 2. My Approach

I thought about how a human would do this:

- First, they'd look for obvious insurance-related words
- Then, they'd understand the context of what the company does
- Finally, they'd match it with the right insurance types

So I built the code to do the same thing!

### 3. The Building Blocks

I used three main techniques:

#### a) Direct Matching (The Easy Way)

```javascript
// I have a list of words like:
const insuranceKeywords = ["insurance", "policy", "coverage", ...];

// If I see these words, I know it's probably insurance-related!
if (text.includes("insurance")) {
    // This is probably an insurance company!
}
```

#### b) Context Understanding (The Smart Way)

```javascript
// I look at different parts of the company info:
- What they do (description)
- Their business tags
- Their industry sector
- Their business category
- Their specific niche

// Each piece helps me understand the company better
```

#### c) Similarity Matching (The Clever Way)

```javascript
// I use something called TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, don't worry about the name)
// Let me explain what this means in simple terms:

// Imagine you're reading a book about insurance:
// - "insurance" appears 10 times
// - "policy" appears 5 times
// - "coverage" appears 3 times
// - "the" appears 100 times

// TF-IDF helps me understand that:
// - "insurance", "policy", and "coverage" are important words
// - "the" is not important, even though it appears more often
// - This helps me match similar documents even if they use different words
//   For example: "health coverage provider" and "medical insurance company"
//   would be considered similar because they use important words in similar ways
```

### 4. How It All Works Together

1. **First Pass**: I look for obvious insurance words

   - "This company sells health insurance" → Easy! It's a health insurance company!

2. **Second Pass**: I check the context

   - "This company provides medical services" → Hmm, might need health insurance!

3. **Third Pass**: I do smart matching
   - I compare the company's description with my list of insurance types
   - I use math (but don't worry, the computer does it!) to find the best matches

### 5. Why I Made These Choices

- **Multiple Methods**: I use different approaches because sometimes the obvious way works, and sometimes I need to be smarter
- **Weighted Importance**: I give more importance to certain fields (like business tags) because they're usually more relevant
- **Flexible Matching**: Companies can have multiple insurance types because real life is complicated!

### 6. The Cool Parts

- It can handle thousands of companies quickly
- It learns from the insurance categories I give it
- It can find insurance types even when they're not explicitly mentioned
- It's like having a really smart intern who never gets tired! ( like me 😁)

### 7. What I Learned

- Sometimes the simplest solution (looking for keywords) is the best
- But you also need smart solutions (like similarity matching) for the tricky cases
- It's okay to use multiple approaches together
- Making the code readable and maintainable is just as important as making it work

### 8. Future Improvements 🚀

Here are some cool things I want to add to make the project even better:

#### a) Smarter Keyword Finding

- Make the system learn new insurance words by itself
- Figure out which words are most important
- Keep track of new insurance terms as they come up
- Connect related words (like "health" and "medical")

#### b) Making It Faster / Parallel Processing Implementation

- Split big jobs into smaller pieces that run at the same time
- Process lots of companies in batches
- Show a progress bar for long-running tasks
- Make sure the system doesn't get overwhelmed

#### c) Saving Time with Caching

- Remember results we've seen before
- Store common calculations so we don't have to do them again
- Keep track of what's in the cache
- Make sure we're not using too much memory

Think of it like this: right now, the system is like a smart intern who reads through company descriptions. With these improvements, it'll be like having a super-fast intern with a photographic memory who never forgets anything they've seen before (Mike)! 🚀
